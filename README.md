# misterfarm-django-terraform
This is a Django app primarily used to learn some Django itself as well as some Terraform

I have not worked on it in a week or so, when last I was working on it I had purchased a domain began running into certificate issues that I still need to work through when I revisit the project.

I also need to add some actual models and endpoints so the app can actually do something - I got caught up in the Terraform aspect so the app itself still doesn't do anything.

I am certainly open to making additions or adjustments as part of an interview process if requested.

(Credit where it's due, this article helped me tremendously when it came to implementing and learning about different aspects of Terraform and even some aspects of AWS - https://testdriven.io/blog/deploying-django-to-ecs-with-terraform/)
